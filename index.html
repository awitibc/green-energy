        <h1>What is green energy?</h1>
        <p>Clean. Green energy, which includes green electricity, is clean energy.
             This means it is produced with little-to-no environmental impact and
              does not dispense greenhouse gases into the air that contribute to global
               warming, the way fossil fuels do.

            Varied.Green energy sources include wind, geo-thermal, hydro, and solar energy.            
            Wind and hydro sources generate energy through the movement of air and water,
             while geo-thermal and solar sources generate energy through heat. All, however
             , provide reliable energy and protect the environment.
            
            Renewable. As stated above, green energy sources eliminate the emission
             of greenhouse gases into the air. These sources are also renewable energy
              sources - meaning they are not created from finite materials like fossil fuels.
            
            Stable. Green energy's varied forms mean more locations across the planet
             have the potential to harvest this renewable energy. This means more 
             energy can be collected right here in the United States, making the
              country less dependent on energy from foreign countries.
            
            Inexpensive. As the demand for green energy continues to grow, the price
             continues to drop thanks to economics of scale. Consider this: between 
             the years 2010 and 2012 the costs associated with producing energy from
              wind dropped by 20 percent, and prices have fallen by more than 80 percent
               since 1980.
            
            Right for You. You've seen the environmental and economic benefits that
             come from turning your home into a green home. The good news is, those
              benefits will increase as green energy continues to gain popularity
               in the market. If you're ready to make the switch to renewable energy,

                <h2>How is green energy used?</h2>
                <p>Green energy is considered today the source of clean power that will replace
                     the dirty energy generated by fossil fuels for a future without pollution.

                    In recent decades, mankind started to understand that we canâ€™t continue burning
                     fossil fuels (coal, oil, natural gas and nuclear) for energy generation,
                      mostly because these are finite sources of power and they also create a
                       massive pollution on the planet.
                    
                    Searching for alternative sources of power (that can replace the fossil fuels)
                    , scientists discovered that the natural sources of energy available on the
                     planet can be used to generate green energy, which is friendly with the 
                     environment and is also sustainable.</p>
                     <h3>What is the history of green energy?</h3>
                     <p>Prior to the development of coal in the mid 19th century, nearly all
                          energy used was renewable. Almost without a doubt the oldest known
                           use of renewable energy, in the form of traditional biomass to
                            fuel fires, dates from more than a million years ago. The use 
                            of biomass for fire did not become commonplace until many                            
                            hundreds of thousands of years later. Probably the second 
                            oldest usage of renewable energy is harnessing the wind in order
                             to drive ships over water. This practice can be traced back some
                              7000 years, to ships in the Persian Gulf and on the Nile.
                               From hot springs, geothermal energy has been used for
                                bathing since Paleolithic times and for space heating since
                                 ancient Roman times. Moving into the time of recorded
                                  history, the primary sources of traditional renewable energy
                                   were human labor, animal power, water power, wind, in grain
                                    crushing windmills, and firewood, a traditional biomass.

                        In the 1860s and 1870s, there were already fears that civilization would
                         run out of fossil fuels and the need was felt for a better source. In
                          1873 Augustin Mouchot wrote:
                        
                        The time will arrive when the industry of Europe will cease to find those
                         natural resources, so necessary for it. Petroleum springs and coal mines
                          are not inexhaustible but are rapidly diminishing in many places. Will                         
                          man, then, return to the power of water and wind? Or will he emigrate
                           where the most powerful source of heat sends its rays to all? History will
                            show what will come.
                        
                        In 1885, Werner von Siemens, commenting on the discovery of the photovoltaic
                         effect in the solid state, wrote:
                        
                        In conclusion, I would say that however great the scientific importance
                         of this discovery may be, its practical value will be no less obvious
                          when we reflect that the supply of solar energy is both without limit
                           and without cost, and that it will continue to pour down upon us for
                            countless ages after all the coal deposits of the earth have been
                             exhausted and forgotten.
                        
                        Max Weber mentioned the end of fossil fuel in the concluding paragraphs
                         of his Die protestantische Ethik und der Geist des Kapitalismus
                          (The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism), published in 1905.
                           Development of solar engines continued until the outbreak of World War I.
                            The importance of solar energy was recognized in a 1911 Scientific
                             American article: "in the far distant future, natural fuels having 
                             been exhausted [solar power] will remain as the only means of
                              existence of the human race".
                        
                        The theory of peak oil was published in 1956. In the 1970s environmentalists
                         promoted the development of renewable energy both as a replacement for the
                          eventual depletion of oil, as well as for an escape from dependence on oil,
                           and the first electricity-generating wind turbines appeared.
                            Solar had long been used for heating and cooling, but solar
                             panels were too costly to build solar farms until 1980.</p>
